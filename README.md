## Goal

The *Super Tank* allows Gobblers owners and Goo holders to pool everything in one tank.

This is not an optimal strategy... but this could meet several needs :
- Goo holders who cannot afford to buy a Gobblers and want to participate.
- TODO

## Getting Started

```sh
git clone https://github.com/maximebrugel/super-tank
cd super-tank
forge install
forge build
forge test
```
